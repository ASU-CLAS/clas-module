# ASU CLAS Panels Tabs

The ASU CLAS Panels Tabs module provides a Panels Pane Style (e.g. ASU CLAS Tabs) that enables jQuery UI Tabs within a Panels row.

The module is a fork of the contributed module, [Panels Tabs][1], and builds upon the Webspark design with special treatment for the CLAS academic unit Research Areas.

In contrast to the Webspark Panels Tabs, the tabs provided by this module are horizontally centered via CSS and by default have a light gray background color.

Removing the CSS class of `asu-clas-tabs-horizontal-gray` will remove the background color and allow the tabs to be used on an area no background color, or white.

On small screen devices, the tab titles are reduced down to a pattern of `Tab + #` (e.g. Tab 1, Tab 2, Tab 3) using CSS media queries so that the interface remains usable despite possibly lengthy tab titles.
