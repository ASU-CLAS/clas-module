# ASU CLAS Psychology Labs

The ASU CLAS Psychology Labs module provides a View and Panels Pane(s) for displaying the Department of Psychology's Research Labs.

It enables Panelizer on the Lab node type and sets up the default configuration (layout, content, etc.).

> Note: A custom content type of 'Lab' was pre-existing in the Drupal database — as well as a taxonomy of 'Lab Research Area' — so this module isn't integrated with Features to create those entities.
