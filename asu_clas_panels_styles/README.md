# ASU CLAS Panels Styles

The ASU CLAS Panels Styles module provides a Panels Pane style with several pre-configured background colors as part of the CLAS brand standards:

* Black `#000`
* White `#fff`
* Midnight `#2a2a2a`
* Gray `#f1f1f1`
* Charcoal `#353535`
* Gold `#ffb30f`

Using the Pane styles provided by this module are recommended over the Webspark "spacing and background colors" style plugin, which unintuitively sets padding and margins on the HTML elements using their CSS classes.

Thus, if only a background color is needed – _without any additional risk of inherited CSS from Webspark causing increased spacing_ – this module is the solution.
